Account recovery allows registered users to regain access to their account if they forget their password or lose access to the
second authentication factor required for multifactor authentication (MFA).

To regain access to their account, the user must prove that they are the owner of the account. The verification of ownership is
performed using the recovery address defined by the user. This could be an email address or a phone number. When the account
recovery flow is initiated, the system sends a link or a one-time code to the recovery address defined by the user. The user must
access the link or enter the code they received to confirm their identity and ownership of the account.

Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) supports two recovery methods:

- Sending one-time passwords (**preferred**)
- Sending magic links

## Configuring self-service account recovery

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="oc-or-oss">
<TabItem value="oc" label="The Ory Network" default>

To adjust account recovery options, go to **Authentication** â†’ **Account Recovery** in the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh/guides)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="oss" label="Self-hosted Ory Kratos config">

You can configure which methods to use in the Ory Kratos config:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
methods:
 code: # this enables the one time password method
   enabled: true
   config:
     # Defines how long a recovery code is valid for (default 1h)
     lifespan: 15m

flows:
 recovery:
   enabled: true

   # Defines how long a recovery flow (the UI interaction) is valid for (default 1h)
   lifespan: 15m
   use: code # Define which strategy to use, either `code` or `link`
```

Keep in mind, that both methods require sending out emails to your users, so an SMTP server is required. Read more
[here](../../emails-sms/01_sending-emails-smtp.mdx).

</Tabs>

## Account recovery addresses

To start account recovery, Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) needs to know which address to send the recovery message to. In most cases
this is the address the user provided when registering their account. Other fields inside the `traits` section are supported as
well.

:::note

If the email address used for recovery is the same as the email used for verification, but the account hasn't been activated yet
(see [Account Activation](./verify-email-account-activation.mdx)), the address will also be verified by completing the account
recovery successfully.

:::

To specify a trait of the identity to be used for recovery, use the following identity schema:

```diff
 {
   "$id": "https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/quickstart/email-password/identity.schema.json",
   "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
   "title": "Person",
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
     "traits": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "email": {
           "type": "string",
           "format": "email",
           "ory.sh/kratos": {
             "credentials": {
               "password": {
                 "identifier": true
               }
             },
+            "recovery": {
+              "via": "email"
+            }
           }
         }
       }
       "additionalProperties": false
     }
   }
 }
```

## Email templates

Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) provides a set of default email templates for the recovery flows.

:::important

In case a user tries to recover an unregistered account, an email is sent out to the email, informing them about the attempted
recovery.

This prevents account enumeration attacks as explained in this
[blog post by Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/website-enumeration-insanity-how-our-personal-data-is-leaked/).

:::

To provide your own templates, see [Customizing E-Mail Templates](../../emails-sms/custom-email-templates).

## Updating credentials

After the user completes the recovery successfully they receive a privileged session and are redirected to the settings page to
update their credentials.

Read more about the [privileged sessions](../../session-management/01_overview.mdx#privileged-sessions).

## Invalidate other sessions

In some scenarios it can be useful to revoke all active sessions once an account has been recovered. This forces anyone with
access to the account to re-authenticate.

```diff
 selfservice:
   flows:
     recovery:
       enabled: true
       ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/recovery
+      after:
+        hooks:
+        - hook: revoke_active_sessions
```

## One-time passwords vs. magic links

The one-time password method (`code`) is preferred, as magic links have multiple drawbacks:

- Some email virus scanners open links in emails to scan them. This invalidates the magic link and a user may not be able to
  recover their account.
- Recovery flows initialized by apps on mobile phones or smart devices don't work with magic links.
- Depending on the device settings, clicking a magic link can open a different browser than the one used to initialize the
  recovery flow. This can confuse your users.

Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) uses one-time passwords by default. Magic links are available for legacy reasons and will be removed
in the future.

:::important

When you change the recovery strategy from `link` to `code` in an existing project, you might need to adjust your UI. Make sure
the flow works correctly with your UI implementation after changing the recovery strategy.

:::

## Multifactor authentication

By design, the account recovery process bypasses the primary account credential. You can choose to require multifactor
authentication for account recovery.

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="oc-or-oss">
  <TabItem value="oc" label="The Ory Network" default>
On the Ory Network Console go to <b>Two-Factor Authentication</b> and disable "Allow Self-Service Settings without Second Factor".
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="oss" label="Self-hosted Ory Kratos config">

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    settings:
      required_aal: highest_available
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

## Code examples for Node.js, React.js, Go

The user interface for the account recovery is a page in your solution that should render the actual render the actual form
elements for the user.

In contrast to other identity systems, Ory Identities (Ory Kratos) doesn't render this HTML directly. Instead, you need to
implement the HTML code in your solution, which gives you complete flexibility and customizability in your user interface flows
and designs. This part of your application then directly interfaces with Ory Identities through the API.

The API responds with a JSON document describing the form elements to render and actions the form should take upon submission,
cancellation, etc. The following shows examples for a few different languages and frameworks.

<RenderFlow flow="recovery" />
