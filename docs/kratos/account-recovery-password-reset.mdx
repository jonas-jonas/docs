Account Recovery must be performed if access to an account needs to be recovered.
Common use cases include:

- "Forgot password" flows
- "Lost MFA device" flows

## Methods

If a user lost their credentials, they need to prove ownership of the account.
This is typically done via a recovery address, such as an email address or phone number via SMS.
By having access to these addresses they prove ownership of the account.

Ory Kratos supports two recovery methods:

- Sending a one time password (**preferred**)
- Sending a "magic link"

### Configuration

<Tabs
  defaultValue="oss"
  values={[
    {label: 'Ory Cloud', value: 'oc'},
    {label: 'Ory Kratos', value: 'oss'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="oc">

Account recovery can be configured in the "Customize/Account Recovery" screen of Ory Cloud.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="oss">

    You can configure which methods to use in the Ory Kratos config:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    code: # this enables the one time password method
      enabled: true
      config:
        # Defines how long a recovery code is valid for (default 1h)
        lifespan: 15m

  flows:
    recovery:
      enabled: true

      # Defines how long a recovery flow (the UI interaction) is valid for (default 1h)
      lifespan: 15m
      use: code
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Recovery Addresses

    <figcaption>
      If the requested email address is an unknown recovery address, an account recovery attempt email is sent to that email
      address.

<p>
  <figure>
    <img alt="Recovery email sent to a known recovery address" src={useBaseUrl("images/kratos/email-recovery-known.png")} />
    <figcaption>
      If the requested email address is a known recovery address, a recovery link is sent to that email address.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</p>

This prevents account enumeration attacks as explained in this
[brilliant blog post by Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/website-enumeration-insanity-how-our-personal-data-is-leaked/).

The emails are using templates that can be customized as explained in
[Customizing E-Mail Templates](emails-sms/custom-email-templates). The template IDs are:


1. **For one time password emails**
   - Unknown email address: `recovery_code_invalid`
   - Known email address: `recovery_code_valid`
1. **For magic links**
   - Unknown email address: `recovery_invalid`
   - Known email address: `recovery_valid`

After the user completed the recovery successfully, they will be redirected to the settings page so they can 
reset their credentials.
They will also be issued a privileged session.

:::note

If the email address used for recovery purposes is the same as the email used for verification purposes and the account hasn't yet
been activated (see [Account Activation](./self-service/flows/verify-email-account-activation.mdx) - 
the address will be marked as verified in Ory Kratos.

:::

<Tabs
  defaultValue="oss"
  values={[
    {label: 'Ory Cloud Platform', value: 'ocp'},
    {label: 'Ory Kratos', value: 'oss'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="ocp">

Configuring the privileged session duration will be possible in the future.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="oss">

You can configure the privileged session duration in the Ory Kratos config:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    settings:
      privileged_session_max_age: 15m
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To specify that an identitys trait is a recovery email, use the following Identity Schema:

```diff
 {
   "$id": "https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/quickstart/email-password/identity.schema.json",
   "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
   "title": "Person",
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
     "traits": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "email": {
           "type": "string",
           "format": "email",
           "ory.sh/kratos": {
             "credentials": {
               "password": {
                 "identifier": true
               }
             },
+            "recovery": {
+              "via": "email"
+            }
           }
         }
       }
       "additionalProperties": false
     }
   }
 }
```

### One Time Passwords vs. Magic Links

The one time password method (`code`) is preferred, as magic links have multiple drawbacks:

- Email virus-scanners sometimes open magic links to scan them. 
This invalidates the link and a user may not be able to revover their account.
- API flows initialized by apps on mobile phones or smart devices are not possible when using magic links.

Ory Kratos uses one time passwords by default.
Magic links are available for legacy reasons and the method is deprecated.


## Initialize recovery flow

<DomainWarning />

The first step is to initialize the Recovery Flow. This sets up Anti-CSRF tokens and more. Each recovery flow has a `state`
parameter which follows the state machine:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram-v2
	[*] --> choose_method
	choose_method --> sent_email
	sent_email --> sent_email
	note right of sent_email
	    The user may fill out the email form input again as a way to re-send the email.
	end note
	sent_email --> passed_challenge
	passed_challenge --> [*]
`}
/>

where

- `choose_method` indicates that the user hasn't chosen a recovery method yet. This is useful when `link` isn't the only recovery
  method active.
- `sent_email` implies that the recovery email has been sent out.
- `passed_challenge` is set when the user has clicked the recovery link and completed the account recovery.

### Recovery for server-side browser clients

The Recovery Flow for browser clients relies on HTTP redirects between Ory Kratos, your Recovery UI, and the end-user's browser:

<SelfServiceBrowserFlow
  flows={["recovery"]}
  success="Set session cookie and initialize Settings Flow"
  interactions={['"Recover account"']}
/>

To initialize the Recovery Flow, point the Browser to the initialization endpoint:

```sh
curl -s -i -X GET \
    -H "Accept: text/html" \
    https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/recovery/browser

HTTP/2 303
date: Fri, 09 Jul 2021 12:50:38 GMT
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
content-length: 120
location: https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/hosted/recovery?flow=33964b22-c364-4217-b6fc-5f381d142d65
cache-control: private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
set-cookie: aHR0cHM6Ly9wbGF5Z3JvdW5kLnByb2plY3RzLm9yeWFwaXMuY29tL2FwaS9rcmF0b3MvcHVibGlj_csrf_token=WCOWjhwHy338874TGz6S7ICVp/hFFVHV8Ev7e1hZYSo=; Path=/api/kratos/public; Domain=playground.projects.oryapis.com; Max-Age=31536000; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None
vary: Origin
vary: Cookie
strict-transport-security: max-age=15724800; includeSubDomains

<a href="https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/hosted/recovery?flow=33964b22-c364-4217-b6fc-5f381d142d65">See Other</a>.
```

The server responds with a HTTP 303 redirect to the Recovery UI, appending the `?flow=<flow-id>` query parameter (see the curl
example) to the URL configured here:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="oss"
  values={[
    {label: 'Ory Cloud Platform', value: 'ocp'},
    {label: 'Ory Kratos', value: 'oss'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="ocp">

The Ory Cloud Platform offers a default UI implementation. Pointing to another UI endpoint will be supported in the future.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="oss">

You can configure which recovery URL to use in the Ory Kratos config:

```yaml title="path/to/config/kratos.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    recovery:
      # becomes http://127.0.0.1:4455/recovery?flow=df607aa1-d555-4b2a-b3e4-0f5a1d2fe6f3
      ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/recovery
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Recovery for client-side (AJAX) browser clients

The Recovery Flow for client-side browser clients relies on AJAX requests.

<AjaxWarning />

<SelfServiceSpaFlow
  flows={["recovery"]}
  success="Set session cookie and initialize Settings Flow"
  interactions={['"Recover account"']}
/>

To initialize the Recovery Flow, call the recovery initialization endpoint and set `Accept: application/json`:

```
curl -v -s -X GET \
    -H "Accept: application/json"  \
    https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/recovery/browser | jq

> GET /self-service/recovery/browser HTTP/2
> Host: playground.projects.oryapis.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
> Accept: application/json

< HTTP/2 200
< date: Fri, 09 Jul 2021 09:36:34 GMT
< content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
< content-length: 1241
< cache-control: private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate

          }
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "state": "choose_method"
}
```

### Recovery for API clients and clients without browsers

<ApiWarning />

The Recovery Flow for API clients doesn't use HTTP Redirects and can be summarized as follows:

<SelfServiceApiFlow flows={["recovery"]} success="Return session token" interactions={['"Recover account"']} />

To initialize the API flow, the client calls the API-flow initialization endpoint
([REST API Reference](../reference/api.mdx#initialize-recovery-flow-for-api-clients)) which returns a JSON response:

```sh
curl -s -X GET \
    -H "Accept: application/json"  \
    https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/recovery/api | jq

{
  "id": "660cc928-48f1-485b-8003-dc690f5afc35",
  "type": "api",
  "expires_at": "2021-07-09T13:52:56.270081773Z",
  "issued_at": "2021-07-09T12:52:56.270081773Z",
  "request_url": "http://playground.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/recovery/api",
  "ui": {
    "action": "https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/recovery?flow=660cc928-48f1-485b-8003-dc690f5afc35",
    "method": "POST",
    "nodes": [ /* */ ]
  },
  "state": "choose_method"
}
```

## Recovery flow payloads

Fetching the Recovery Flow ([REST API Reference](../reference/api.mdx#get-recovery-flow)) is usually only required for browser
clients but also works for Recovery Flows initialized by API clients. All you need is a valid flow ID:

```sh
flowId=$(curl -s -X GET \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/recovery/api | jq -r '.id')

curl -s -X GET \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/recovery/flows?id=$flowId" | jq

{
  "id": "7c033350-a935-4807-a06e-85cfc2475c75",
  "type": "api",
  "expires_at": "2021-07-09T14:00:52.752217Z",
  "issued_at": "2021-07-09T13:00:52.752217Z",
  "request_url": "http://playground.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/recovery/api",
  "active": "default",
  "ui": {
    "action": "https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/recovery?flow=7c033350-a935-4807-a06e-85cfc2475c75",
    "method": "POST",
    "nodes": [ /* ... */ ]
  },
  "state": "choose_method"
}
```

### Send recovery link to email

:::note

The `link` recovery mode will always open a link in the browser, even if it was initiated by an API client. This is because the
user clicks the link in his/her email client, which opens the browser.

:::

When the `link` method is enabled, it will be part of the `methods` payload in the Recovery Flow:

```shell script
curl -H "Accept: application/json" -s \
    'https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/recovery/flows?id=199a2c74-08ca-4f22-b24c-3de3032682f8' | \
      jq -r '.ui.nodes[] | select(.group=="link")'

{
  "type": "input",
  "group": "link",
  "attributes": {
    "name": "email",
    "type": "email",
    "required": true,
    "disabled": false
  },
  "messages": null,
  "meta": {}
}
{
  "type": "input",
  "group": "link",
  "attributes": {
    "name": "method",
    "type": "submit",
    "value": "link",
    "disabled": false
  },
  "messages": null,
  "meta": {
    "label": {
      "id": 1070005,
      "text": "Submit",
      "type": "info"
    }
  }
}
```

## Recovery form validation

The form payloads are then submitted to Ory Kratos which follows up with:

- An HTTP 303 See Other redirect pointing to the Registration UI for Browser Clients;
- An `application/json` response for API Clients and Client-Side Browser applications (for example Single Page Apps).

### Recovery link via email

To send the recovery email, the end-user fills out the form. There might be validation errors such as a malformed email:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodLinkWithErrors} />

When validation errors happen, browser clients receive a HTTP 303 See Other redirect to the Recovery Flow UI, containing the
Recovery Flow ID which includes the error payloads.

For API Clients, the server typically responds with HTTP 400 Bad Request and the Recovery Flow in the response payload as JSON.

#### Successful submission

On successful submission, an email will be sent to the provided address:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodLinkSuccess} />

## Unsuccessful recovery

If the recovery challenge (for example the link in the recovery email) is invalid or expired, the user will be HTTP 303 redirected
to the Recovery UI.

:::note

When an invalid or expired challenge is used, Ory Kratos initializes a new Account Recovery flow automatically. This flow will
always be a Browser-based flow because the challenge is completed by clicking a link!

:::

The new Recovery Flow includes an error message such as the following:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodLinkInvalidChallenge} />

Please keep in mind that this part of the flow always involves a Browser!

## Successful recovery

Completing account recovery always results in a HTTP 303 redirect with a Ory Kratos Login Session Cookie to the Settings UI with a
Settings Flow prompting the user to update their password or credentials:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodLinkChallengeDone} />

## Code examples for Node.js, React.js, Go, ...

The Recovery User Interface is a route (page / site) in your application (server, native app, single page app) that should render
a recovery form.

In stark contrast to other Identity Systems, Ory Kratos doesn't render this HTML. Instead, you need to implement the HTML code in
your application (for example Node.js + Express.js, Java, PHP, React.js, ...), which gives you extreme flexibility and
customizability in your user interface flows and designs.

You will use the Recovery Flow JSON response to render the recovery form UI, which could looks as follows depending on your
programming language and web framework:

<RenderFlow flow="recovery" />
